#Patrick Gold Portfolio

##Dependencies
* Node & npm install
* Grunt install globally

##Build System
The build system relies on NPM, Bower and Grunt.

To get up and running as quickly as possible, run:

        $ npm install

This will install all node modules, all bower components, and start a local server using BrowserSync

##Credits
The grunt task loading has been borrowed heavily from [Bolt](https://github.com/argyleink/Bolt) with some changes here and there to better support angular.
